# Paycheck to Paycheck

a web app for [United Way of Central Carolinas](http://www.uwcentralcarolinas.org/) to: 

* create awareness about poverty using real Charlotte data
* simulate tough choices made by those in poverty
* give links to share, donate, and volunteer

Made by [Team Povizio](http://josephjguerra.github.io/teampovizio/) in [Skookum's](http://skookum.com/) [Night Shift 2.0](http://www.nightshiftc.lt/) program. Povizio is a play on words for poverty, visual awareness, and choices.
