 * set (integer, default: null): The app currently uses this to set state for remembering what option was 
 *   selected. Move out of appAreas and into app state? One benefit is that this can be used to set an

 * type (string: normal, fact, setback, etc.) When set to "normal", the item name will appear in the drawer.
