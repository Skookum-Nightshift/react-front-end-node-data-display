 * The app follows the order of this array.
 *
 * name (string): the page's heading
 * desc (string): The description under the icon/image.
 * options (array of integers): each item can have as many or as few budget options as necessary.
 * set (integer, default: null): The app currently uses this to set state for remembering what option was 
 *   selected. Move out of appAreas and into app state? One benefit is that this can be used to set an
 *   optional default other than null.
 * type (string: normal, fact, setback, etc.) When set to "normal", the item name will appear in the drawer.
 * optionDesc: an array of strings, each coinciding with the earlier array of options.
 *
 * To DO
 * make this into a pure JSON gile
 * get better icons
